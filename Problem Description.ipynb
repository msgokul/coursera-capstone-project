For ease of transportation, hybrid /electric cars were been introduced to the market which attracts the majority of the population.Therefore,more vehicles on the road leds to the drastic leap in the collision rates as well.\n\nThe Seattle government is going to prevent avoidable car accidents by employing methods that alert drivers through alert display system and police to be more careful in critical situations.In most cases, not paying enough attention during driving, drugs and alcohol or driving at very high speed for fun/competition are the main causes of occurring accidents that can be prevented by deploying harsher regulations. Besides the causes, weather, visibility, or road conditions are the major uncontrollable factors that can be prevented by revealing hidden patterns in the data and announcing warning to the local government, police and drivers on the targeted roads.\n\nThe target audience of the project is local Seattle government, police, rescue groups and insurance organisation as well. This model results will provide them to make insightful decisions for reducing the number of accidents for the city.\n"
